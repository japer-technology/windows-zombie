## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-28

### Changed — Platform pivot: Ubuntu → Windows 11

- Rebranded the project and repository to `windows11-zombie` for the
  Windows 11 port.
- Replaced the Bash/systemd/sudo/apt/UFW/logrotate integration layer with
  PowerShell, Windows Services, Scheduled Tasks, WinGet, Windows Defender
  Firewall, ACL-protected `C:\ProgramData\AiZombie\` state, and built-in
  agent log rotation.
- Added `Windows11Zombie-Chat` service supervision and the
  `Windows11Zombie-Health` Scheduled Task running `Health-Check.ps1` as
  SYSTEM.
- Moved the trust model to Windows identities: `LocalSystem` by default,
  with an optional local Administrators account named `zombie` for service
  identity parity.
- Documented the Windows policy gate as the sole privileged-action
  boundary, with read-only diagnostics auto-run, mutating actions requiring
  operator approval, and destructive actions requiring an explicit
  confirmation phrase.
- Updated the agent OS-abstraction layer and documentation for Windows
  command dispatch: services, Event Log, WinGet, Defender Firewall,
  local users/groups, Tailscale, screenshots, and GUI actions.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Installer Node runtime.** `scripts/install.sh` now installs
  Node.js 22.x from the official NodeSource apt repository instead
  of the Ubuntu-archive `nodejs`/`npm` packages. The bundled npm on
  Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04 (npm 9.x on Node 18) could not self-upgrade to
  `npm@latest`, which now requires Node `^20.17.0 || >=22.9.0`, so
  the "Node runtime" section failed with `EBADENGINE` and aborted
  the install after retries. The NodeSource source is configured
  with a `signed-by` keyring at `/usr/share/keyrings/nodesource.gpg`
  and the `nodejs` package is pinned to the NodeSource origin via
  `/etc/apt/preferences.d/nodejs`. `docs/REQUIRES.md` updated.

### Added
- **Verbose scribe (opt-in debugging).** `payload/agent/audit.py`
  honours `ZOMBIE_AUDIT_VERBOSE=1` to attach a redacted
  `stdout_preview` / `stderr_preview` (default 2 KiB, tunable via
  `ZOMBIE_AUDIT_PREVIEW_BYTES`, hard-capped at 16 KiB) to every
  `tool_call` entry. Existing SHA-256 digests are unchanged so the
  integrity contract holds. Every audit entry now also carries
  `ts_utc` (ISO-8601 UTC) and `pid` so testers can correlate audit
  lines with `journalctl` without timezone math. `payload/bin/audit-recent`
  gained `--follow`/`-f` (tail -F across logrotate) and `-t TYPE`
  filters and now surfaces previews when present. Smoke tests cover
  the redaction round-trip and the always-on `pid` / `ts_utc` fields.
  Documented in `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` and `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
- Phase 4 of `docs/UPGRADE-TO-PI-PLAN.md` — hardening pass:
  - **P4.1** Per-turn budget defaults realigned with
    `docs/UPGRADE-TO-PI.md` §6.1–§6.2 (`max_tool_calls_per_turn` 12,
    `max_elevated_calls_per_turn` 3) in `payload/etc/policy.yaml` and
    `payload/agent/policy.py`. `server.py` now enforces
    `max_elevated_calls_per_turn` and `pi_mono.py` emits a uniform
    synthetic `budget_exceeded:` observation when either budget is
    exceeded; the synthetic observation is recorded in the JSONL audit
    (`decision="budget_exceeded"`) and the history `events` table.
    `tests/smoke.sh` gained regression tests against
    `tests/fixtures/stub-pi-mono.mjs` that drive both budgets through
    the soft-failure path. `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` updated.
  - **P4.2** Persistent `pi-mono` evaluated and declined (no-go).
    Rationale recorded in `docs/UPGRADE-TO-PI-PLAN.md` §11; no code
    change.
- Phase 2 of `docs/UPGRADE-TO-PI-PLAN.md` — atomic cutover from the
  fenced-bash parser to the `pi-mono` agent loop:
  - **P2.1** Pinned `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` via
    `payload/agent/pi-mono.version`; installer runs `npm install -g`
    against the pinned version and `verify` asserts the pin.
  - **P2.2** Closed 13-tool registry in `payload/agent/tools.py`
    (`shell.run`, `fs.read`, `fs.write`, `pkg.query`, `pkg.install`,
    `svc.status`, `svc.control`, `net.status`, `gui.screenshot`,
    `gui.click`, `gui.type`, `skill.list`, `skill.load`) with per-tool
    schema validation, path allow-lists for filesystem tools, and
    fail-closed dispatch.
  - **P2.3** Additive history schema migration in
    `payload/agent/history.py` via `PRAGMA user_version`, with a
    pre-migration snapshot saved to
    `state/conversations.db.bak.<ts>`. New `events` table records
    structured `tool_call`/`tool_observation`/`pending_tool_call`
    events for the UI replay.
  - **P2.4** Node bridge (`payload/agent/pi-mono-bridge.mjs`) wraps
    `pi --mode json --no-builtin-tools --tools <names>` and speaks a
    line-delimited JSON protocol to the Python client
    (`payload/agent/pi_mono.py`). `ZOMBIE_PI_MONO_BRIDGE` lets the
    smoke suite swap in `tests/fixtures/stub-pi-mono.mjs`.
  - **P2.5** Per-tool approval UI: `payload/agent/templates/index.html`
    replaces `renderProposal` with `tool_call`/`tool_observation`/
    `pending_tool_call` renderers, a per-turn budget counter, and
    `tool_call_id`-keyed approval POSTs.
  - **P2.6** New `policy.yaml` blocks (`tool_classes:` and
    `agent: max_tool_calls_per_turn / max_elevated_calls_per_turn`),
    classified via `policy.classify_tool`. Audit log gains
    `log_tool_call(...)` recording SHA-256 + byte count of stdout/
    stderr (never raw content), plus extended sensitive-env redaction.
  - Installer + `uninstall.sh` updates: deploy `pi-mono-bridge.mjs`,
    render `/opt/ai-zombie/pi/{settings.json,APPEND_SYSTEM.md}`,
    create `state/logs/` and `state/pi-mono-sessions/`, snapshot the
    DB before migration, add pi-mono checks to `verify`, re-render
    pi configs from `cmd_repair`, and prompt to remove the global
    `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` package on uninstall.

### Added
- `LICENSE`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `.editorconfig` so the repository
  metadata matches the documented GitHub project layout.
- Smoke coverage and CI checks for required repository metadata and the
  release package source bundle.
- `ZOMBIE_USER` env var to choose the local Linux account name used as
  the operating identity of the AI Systems Administrator. The legacy
  `AGENT_USER` is still honoured as a backward-compatible alias.
- Phase 0 of `docs/UPGRADE-TO-PI-PLAN.md` (the security prerequisites
  Phase 2 depends on):
  - **P0.1** Argv-aware classifier in `payload/agent/policy.py`. The
    classifier now splits pipelines/sequences, strips leading
    `VAR=value` env prefixes and `sudo` flags, and re-applies every
    rule to the canonical argv in addition to the rendered whole
    command. This catches `LC_ALL=C ls`, `sudo -u root systemctl …`,
    and `rm -rf "/quoted path"` that the legacy regex-only matcher
    missed.
  - **P0.2** Fail-closed default: `settings.default_class` ships as
    `destructive` so unknown commands cannot auto-run. Documented in
    `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`.
  - **P0.3** `sudo_allow_list:` in `payload/etc/policy.yaml` keeps
    common privileged targets (`apt`, `systemctl`, `ufw`, `tailscale`,
    …) at `system_change` despite the conservative default. Documented
    in `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`.

### Changed
- The agent account created by the installer is now called `zombie` by
  default (previously `agent`). The name is overridable at install time
  via `ZOMBIE_USER`, and is propagated to the sudoers drop-in, the
  systemd `User=`/`Group=` of `ubuntu-zombie-chat.service`, the venv
  ownership, the SSH `AllowUsers` line, and the chat service system
  prompt. Existing installs are unaffected — re-run the installer with
  `ZOMBIE_USER=agent` (or `AGENT_USER=agent`) to keep the old name.


  tools, and a loopback-only x11vnc desktop, plus an end-of-install
  verification script.
