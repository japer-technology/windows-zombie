# Quickstart

The shortest safe path from a fresh Ubuntu Desktop LTS install to a
working private chat with the AI Systems Administrator.

Total wall time: roughly 15–30 minutes, mostly waiting for `apt` and
`playwright install`.

---

## 0. Before you start

You need:

- A physical Ubuntu Desktop **22.04 LTS** or **24.04 LTS** machine,
  freshly installed and updated.
- A Tailscale account and a [pre-auth key](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys)
  (recommended) or a working browser to log in interactively.
- One SSH public key (`ssh-ed25519 …` is preferred) from the machine
  you will use to control this PC.
- One LLM API key from a supported provider. All providers are routed
  through `@earendil-works/pi-ai`; pick exactly one:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-…`
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-…`
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY=…`
  - `XAI_API_KEY=…`
  - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=…` (also requires `ZOMBIE_MODEL=…`)
  - `MISTRAL_API_KEY=…`
  - `GROQ_API_KEY=…`
- A keyboard physically attached to the PC for the first run.

Do **not** run the installer over a public SSH session. The installer
restarts `sshd` and tightens the firewall; you can lock yourself out.

### How to get an SSH key

If you do not already have an SSH key on the workstation you will use
to control this PC, generate one there (not on the Ubuntu Zombie box):

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@workstation"
```

Accept the default path (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) and pick a passphrase.
Two files are created:

- `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` — the **private** key. Never copy this off the
  workstation and never paste it into the installer.
- `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` — the **public** key. This is the single
  line (starting with `ssh-ed25519 …`) that you pass to the installer
  as `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` or paste when the interactive installer asks.

Print the public key so you can copy it:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

On macOS you can pipe it straight to the clipboard:

```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

On a Linux workstation with `xclip` or `wl-copy`:

```bash
xclip -selection clipboard < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub   # X11
wl-copy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub                       # Wayland
```

If you already manage keys through GitHub, any key listed at
<https://github.com/settings/keys> works; fetch them with
`curl https://github.com/<your-username>.keys` and pick the
`ssh-ed25519 …` line you recognise.

Older RSA keys (`ssh-rsa …`, 3072-bit or larger) are accepted, but
`ed25519` is preferred: shorter, faster, and the default on modern
OpenSSH.

## 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/japer-technology/ubuntu-zombie.git
cd ubuntu-zombie
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
sudo ./scripts/install.sh install
```

Non-interactive variant (CI, fleet provisioning, scripted re-install):

```bash
sudo ZOMBIE_NONINTERACTIVE=1 \
     ZOMBIE_USER=zombie \
     SSH_PUBLIC_KEY="ssh-ed25519 AAAA… you@workstation" \
     VNC_PASSWORD="replace-me" \
     TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY="tskey-auth-…" \
     ZOMBIE_ENABLE_AUTOLOGIN=0 \
     ./scripts/install.sh install
```

`ZOMBIE_USER` is optional; omit it to get the default account name
`zombie`. Set it to any valid local username if you would rather the
AI Systems Administrator live in (for example) `admin` or `ai`.

Set `ZOMBIE_SKIP_TAILSCALE=1` to skip installing and enrolling
Tailscale (in which case inbound SSH is allowed on every interface
instead of being restricted to the `tailscale0` interface, and
`TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY` is ignored).

Re-running `install` is safe. The script is idempotent. If something
drifts later (file permissions, missing service, dropped Tailscale
session), run:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/install.sh repair
```

### Upgrade / refresh from GitHub

The same `install` subcommand is also the upgrade path. There is no
separate `upgrade` command — pulling the latest source and re-running
`install` is the supported way to move to a newer version, and it is
also the inner loop while debugging a problem you have just fixed
upstream:

```bash
cd ubuntu-zombie
git pull                                   # refresh from GitHub
sudo ./scripts/install.sh install          # re-apply, idempotent
# (or, for a non-interactive box, re-use the same env vars as the
#  initial install — SSH_PUBLIC_KEY, VNC_PASSWORD, etc. are read from
#  the existing /opt/ai-zombie/state on subsequent runs, so usually
#  only ZOMBIE_NONINTERACTIVE=1 is required.)
sudo ZOMBIE_NONINTERACTIVE=1 ./scripts/install.sh install
```

After the re-run, restart the chat service to pick up any new payload
or service-unit changes, then re-verify:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ubuntu-zombie-chat.service
/opt/ai-zombie/bin/verify
```

A reboot is only required if the upgrade touches kernel packages,
GDM/autologin, or Docker group membership — `verify` will say so. For
a documentation- or payload-only refresh, the restart above is enough.

## 2. Reboot

```bash
sudo reboot
```

A reboot is required so the new desktop session, GDM autologin choice,
and Docker group membership take effect.

## 3. Verify

After reboot, log in as `zombie` (or whatever name you passed via
`ZOMBIE_USER` at install time, or SSH in over Tailscale) and run:

```bash
/opt/ai-zombie/bin/verify
```

(The same check is also reachable as `zombie-verify` on `PATH`.)

You should see a green block of `[ok]` checks. Anything red is
explained by:

```bash
/opt/ai-zombie/bin/health-check          # also on PATH as: zombie-health
sudo ./scripts/install.sh doctor
```

To re-apply known-safe fixes (permissions, service restart, Tailscale
re-auth with `TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY`), run:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/install.sh repair
```

## 4. Add an API key

```bash
sudo /opt/ai-zombie/bin/secrets-edit     # also on PATH as: secrets-edit
```

Uncomment exactly one provider line and paste your key. All providers
are routed through `@earendil-works/pi-ai`:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-…
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-…
# GEMINI_API_KEY=…
# XAI_API_KEY=…
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY=…
# MISTRAL_API_KEY=…
# GROQ_API_KEY=…

# Optional knobs:
ZOMBIE_PROVIDER=openai     # openai|anthropic|gemini|xai|openrouter|mistral|groq
ZOMBIE_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini   # override default model (required for openrouter)
```

Restart the chat service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ubuntu-zombie-chat.service
```

## 5. Start chat

Locally:

```
http://127.0.0.1:7878/
```

(Override the port at install time with `ZOMBIE_CHAT_PORT=<port>`.)

Remotely over Tailscale (SSH tunnel; the chat never binds to a public
interface):

```bash
ssh -L 7878:127.0.0.1:7878 zombie@<tailscale-name-or-ip>
# then open http://127.0.0.1:7878/ in your local browser
```

## 6. Ask a diagnostic question

Try one of the safe examples shipped with the chat:

- "Explain this machine."
- "Check whether updates are available."
- "Why is Docker not usable yet?"
- "Show recent failed systemd services."

Read-only questions are answered without prompting for approval.

## 7. Approve a safe command

When the assistant proposes a command in a non-read-only class, the UI
shows a clearly labelled approval card. Approve it and the command runs
as the agent account (`zombie` by default) and is logged.

## 8. Inspect the audit log

```bash
/opt/ai-zombie/bin/audit-recent          # also on PATH as: audit-recent
```

You will see a JSON-lines summary of prompts, proposed actions,
approvals, commands, exit codes, and verification results. Secrets are
redacted.

## 9. Stop or revoke

Temporarily stop the agent:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop ubuntu-zombie-chat.service
```

Revoke the provider:

```bash
sudo /opt/ai-zombie/bin/secrets-edit   # remove or comment out the key
sudo systemctl restart ubuntu-zombie-chat.service
```

The chat UI will then refuse to send new prompts to a provider.

## 10. Uninstall or keep running

Keep running: do nothing.

Uninstall:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/uninstall.sh --dry-run      # preview
sudo ./scripts/install.sh uninstall        # remove (interactive)
sudo ./scripts/uninstall.sh --archive      # archive /home/<agent> and
                                           # /opt/ai-zombie/state/ to
                                           # /var/backups/ before removal
sudo ./scripts/uninstall.sh --yes          # skip confirmations
sudo ./scripts/uninstall.sh --keep-agent   # leave the local user in place
```

Flags must be passed to `scripts/uninstall.sh` directly. The
`scripts/install.sh uninstall` subcommand has no flags of its own and
its argument parser will reject any unknown flags (e.g.
`Unknown flag: --dry-run`); use it only for a plain interactive
uninstall.

Uninstall removes the chat service, sudoers drop-in, SSH drop-in,
x11vnc autostart, generated helpers, policy, logrotate rule, and
(with confirmation) the local agent account (`zombie` by default, or
whatever `ZOMBIE_USER` was set to). It intentionally does **not**
remove Docker, Tailscale, Node, Python, or other base packages —
those are normal Ubuntu software that other things may depend on.
