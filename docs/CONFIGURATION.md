# Configuration

Everything an operator can tune after a successful install.

## Provider keys

Provider credentials live in `/opt/ai-zombie/secrets/env`, mode `0600`,
owned by the local agent account (default `zombie:zombie`; whatever
name was passed to `ZOMBIE_USER` at install time). Edit them with the
safe helper, which re-asserts permissions after `$EDITOR` exits:

```bash
sudo /opt/ai-zombie/bin/secrets-edit
```

Supported variables:

| Variable             | Purpose                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`     | API key for the OpenAI provider          |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`  | API key for the Anthropic provider       |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`     | API key for Google Gemini (routed via `pi-ai`'s `google` provider) |
| `XAI_API_KEY`        | API key for the xAI provider             |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | API key for the OpenRouter aggregator. Requires `ZOMBIE_MODEL` to be set to a fully-qualified id such as `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`. |
| `MISTRAL_API_KEY`    | API key for the Mistral provider         |
| `GROQ_API_KEY`       | API key for the Groq provider            |
| `ZOMBIE_PROVIDER`    | One of `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, `xai`, `mistral`, `groq`, `openrouter` (default: first key found, in that order) |
| `ZOMBIE_MODEL`       | Override the provider's default model (required for `openrouter`) |
| `ZOMBIE_OPENAI_MODEL`     | Override the default model used when the active provider is `openai` |
| `ZOMBIE_ANTHROPIC_MODEL`  | Override the default model used when the active provider is `anthropic` |
| `ZOMBIE_GEMINI_MODEL`     | Override the default model used when the active provider is `gemini` |
| `ZOMBIE_XAI_MODEL`        | Override the default model used when the active provider is `xai` |
| `ZOMBIE_MISTRAL_MODEL`    | Override the default model used when the active provider is `mistral` |
| `ZOMBIE_GROQ_MODEL`       | Override the default model used when the active provider is `groq` |
| `ZOMBIE_OPENROUTER_MODEL` | Fully-qualified OpenRouter model id (e.g. `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`); takes precedence over `ZOMBIE_MODEL` for `openrouter` |
| `ZOMBIE_CHAT_PORT`   | Loopback port for the chat UI (default `7878`) |
| `DISPLAY`            | X display for desktop helpers (default `:0`; pre-seeded in the generated `secrets/env`) |

Per-provider defaults if no `ZOMBIE_MODEL` / `ZOMBIE_<PROVIDER>_MODEL`
override is set (from `payload/agent/providers.py`):

| Provider     | Default model               |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
| `openai`     | `gpt-4o-mini`               |
| `anthropic`  | `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`  |
| `gemini`     | `gemini-2.0-flash`          |
| `xai`        | `grok-2-1212`               |
| `mistral`    | `mistral-small-latest`      |
| `groq`       | `llama-3.1-8b-instant`      |
| `openrouter` | *(no default; must be set)* |

All providers are routed through [`@earendil-works/pi-ai`][pi-ai],
installed globally by `scripts/install.sh` at the version pinned in
`payload/agent/pi-ai.version`. The chat service shells out to the Node
bridge at `/opt/ai-zombie/agent/pi-ai-bridge.mjs`; there are no
bespoke per-provider Python clients.

Restart the chat service after editing:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ubuntu-zombie-chat.service
```

## Agent account name

The installer creates a single local Linux user as the operating
identity of the AI Systems Administrator. The default name is
`zombie`. To pick a different name, pass `ZOMBIE_USER` to the
installer:

```bash
sudo ZOMBIE_USER=admin ./scripts/install.sh install
```

The same variable must be set on every later `install`, `verify`,
`doctor`, `repair`, or `uninstall` run that targets a non-default
account. `AGENT_USER` is still accepted as a backward-compatible alias
so older installs (which used `agent`) can still be repaired or
removed by exporting `AGENT_USER=agent`.

The chosen name appears throughout: `/home/<name>`, the sudoers
drop-in `/etc/sudoers.d/90-<name>-ubuntu-zombie`, the systemd
`User=`/`Group=` of `ubuntu-zombie-chat.service`, and the system
prompt the chat service hands to the LLM.

## Rotating provider keys

1. `sudo /opt/ai-zombie/bin/secrets-edit` — replace the value.
2. `sudo systemctl restart ubuntu-zombie-chat.service`.
3. Optionally revoke the old key in the provider's console.

## Revoking the agent

To stop useful agent operation immediately:

```bash
sudo /opt/ai-zombie/bin/secrets-edit   # delete every API key
sudo systemctl restart ubuntu-zombie-chat.service
```

The chat will load but refuse to call any provider.

To stop the service entirely:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now ubuntu-zombie-chat.service
```

To remove privileged access without uninstalling everything:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/90-zombie-ubuntu-zombie
```

## Policy

`/etc/ubuntu-zombie/policy.yaml` controls what the agent may run
without approval, what requires approval, and what requires the extra
destructive confirmation phrase. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the action
classes. The chat service reloads the policy on every request — no
restart needed.

### Fail-closed default

`settings.default_class` is the classification used when no rule
matches a proposed command. The shipped default is `destructive` —
the highest gated class — so unknown commands cannot auto-run.
Operators may relax this to a lower class once a workflow is proven
safe.

### Sudo allow-list

`sudo_allow_list:` (a top-level list of program names) keeps common
privileged commands at `system_change` despite the conservative
fail-closed default. The standard approval prompt still fires for
these — they do not auto-run — but they are not escalated to
`destructive`. Entries are matched against the basename of the
program that `sudo` invokes (after `sudo` consumes its own flags), so
`sudo apt install foo`, `sudo -u root systemctl restart sshd`, and
`sudo -E /usr/bin/apt update` are all classified by the entries for
`apt` and `systemctl`. Add entries only after confirming the
underlying program is safe to elevate.

### Tool classes and per-turn budgets

The agent emits structured tool calls from a closed 13-tool registry
defined in `payload/agent/tools.py`:

| Tool              | Registry default class | Purpose                                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `shell.run`       | per-argv via `classify` | Run a shell command through the existing runner.          |
| `fs.read`         | `read_only`            | Read a UTF-8 text file within the readable allow-list.     |
| `fs.write`        | `user_change`          | Write text content to a path within the writable allow-list. |
| `pkg.query`       | `read_only`            | Query installed package metadata via dpkg/apt-cache.       |
| `pkg.install`     | `system_change`        | Install Debian packages via apt-get.                       |
| `svc.status`      | `read_only`            | Inspect a systemd unit (status / is-active).               |
| `svc.control`     | `system_change`        | Start/stop/restart/reload/enable/disable a systemd unit.   |
| `net.status`      | `read_only`            | Read-only firewall/Tailscale/interface inspection.         |
| `gui.screenshot`  | `read_only`            | Capture the desktop session into the state directory.      |
| `gui.click`       | `user_change`          | Move to (x, y) and click a mouse button via xdotool.       |
| `gui.type`        | `user_change`          | Type text into the focused window via xdotool.             |
| `skill.list`      | `read_only`            | Enumerate available skills.                                |
| `skill.load`      | `read_only`            | Read the markdown body of a skill by name.                 |

Two `policy.yaml` blocks control them:

```yaml
tool_classes:
  # Override the registry default for a tool. shell.run is always
  # classified per-argv via classify(); listed tools take the class
  # below before classify_tool falls back to the registry default.
  fs.write: user_change
  pkg.install: system_change

agent:
  max_tool_calls_per_turn: 12        # total tool calls per user message
  max_elevated_calls_per_turn: 3     # cap on non read_only calls
```

Budget enforcement:

- `max_tool_calls_per_turn` is enforced by `pi_mono.run_turn` and the
  bridge — once exceeded, the agent receives a synthetic
  `budget_exceeded:` observation for further calls.
- `max_elevated_calls_per_turn` is enforced by `server.py` against the
  classification returned by `policy.classify_tool`. Each call past the
  budget is recorded as a `budget_exceeded` audit decision and the
  agent sees the same synthetic observation so it ends the turn
  cleanly. The same counter drives the operator-facing per-turn
  budget badge in the UI.

### pi-mono runtime

The installer pins `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` to the version in
`payload/agent/pi-mono.version` and renders runtime configs into
`/opt/ai-zombie/pi/`:

| Path                                   | Purpose                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `/opt/ai-zombie/pi/settings.json`      | pi-mono settings (`--no-builtin-tools`)  |
| `/opt/ai-zombie/pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md`   | rendered system-prompt prelude           |
| `/opt/ai-zombie/agent/pi-mono-bridge.mjs` | Node bridge wrapping `pi --mode json` |
| `/opt/ai-zombie/state/logs/pi-mono.*.log` | per-turn bridge logs, rotated daily   |
| `/opt/ai-zombie/state/pi-mono-sessions/`  | pi session/checkpoint state           |

Environment overrides for the `pi-mono` runtime are documented in
[Advanced environment overrides](#advanced-environment-overrides)
below (look for the `ZOMBIE_PI_MONO_*` variables).

## Tailscale

By default the installer enrols the machine into your Tailscale tailnet
and restricts inbound SSH to the `tailscale0` interface via UFW. To
re-enrol or change accounts:

```bash
sudo tailscale logout
sudo tailscale up
```

For unattended installs, set `TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY` to a Tailscale
pre-auth key before running `install`; the installer will run
`tailscale up --ssh=false --authkey "$TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY"` for you.
The variable is ignored when `ZOMBIE_SKIP_TAILSCALE=1`.

The chat service never binds outside `127.0.0.1`; remote access is by
SSH tunnel only.

### Skipping Tailscale (no Tailscale account)

If you do not have (or do not want to use) a Tailscale account, run the
installer with `ZOMBIE_SKIP_TAILSCALE=1`:

```bash
sudo ZOMBIE_SKIP_TAILSCALE=1 ./scripts/install.sh install
```

When set, the installer will:

- skip installing the Tailscale apt repo, `tailscale` package, and
  `tailscaled` enablement;
- skip the interactive `tailscale up` prompt and ignore
  `TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY`;
- configure UFW to allow inbound SSH on **every** interface instead of
  only `tailscale0`.

This trades the Tailscale-only ingress posture for reachability on
whatever network the machine sits on. SSH is still key-only and
root-disabled, and the chat/VNC services still bind to `127.0.0.1`
only, but anyone who can route to port 22 on the host can attempt to
authenticate. Use this mode only on a network you control (e.g. behind
a home router/NAT) or behind another VPN.

Re-run the installer without `ZOMBIE_SKIP_TAILSCALE` at any time to
enrol the machine into Tailscale and re-tighten UFW.

## Autologin

By default Ubuntu Zombie does **not** enable graphical autologin. To
enable it (required for unattended desktop automation), re-run the
installer with:

```bash
sudo ZOMBIE_ENABLE_AUTOLOGIN=1 ./scripts/install.sh install
```

Autologin trades a meaningful slice of physical-access security for
the ability for the agent to drive the desktop without a human first
typing the password. Read `SECURITY.md` before enabling it.

## VNC

`x11vnc` binds to `127.0.0.1:${VNC_PORT:-5900}` only and starts via
the agent account's GNOME autostart entry. Tunnel to it over
Tailscale:

```bash
ssh -L 5900:127.0.0.1:5900 zombie@<tailscale-name-or-ip>
# open a VNC viewer at localhost:5900
```

Reset the password:

```bash
sudo -u zombie x11vnc -storepasswd
```

The port is fixed at install time. To change it, re-run the
installer with `VNC_PORT=<n>` (and re-tunnel accordingly):

```bash
sudo VNC_PORT=5901 ./scripts/install.sh install
```

## Chat access

The chat UI is served at `http://127.0.0.1:${ZOMBIE_CHAT_PORT:-7878}/`.
Tunnel over Tailscale exactly the same way as VNC. There is no
authentication on the loopback socket itself — anyone with shell
access as the agent account (default `zombie`) or root can use it.
That matches the trust model: having a shell on the box is already
root-equivalent.

## Logs and state

| Path                                       | Purpose                                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `/var/log/ubuntu-zombie-install.log`       | Installer transcripts                           |
| `/var/log/ubuntu-zombie/audit.log`         | JSON-lines AI audit trail                       |
| `/opt/ai-zombie/state/conversations.db`    | Chat history (SQLite)                           |
| `/opt/ai-zombie/state/screen.png`          | Latest screenshot helper output                 |
| `/opt/ai-zombie/state/logs/pi-mono.*.log`  | Per-turn pi-mono bridge logs (rotated daily)    |
| `/opt/ai-zombie/state/pi-mono-sessions/`   | pi session/checkpoint state                     |

## Operator helpers

`scripts/install.sh` installs a small set of helper commands under
`/opt/ai-zombie/bin/`:

| Command                | Purpose                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `secrets-edit`         | Safely edit `secrets/env`; re-asserts `0600` mode after `$EDITOR` exits |
| `health-check`         | One-shot health summary (chat service, Tailscale, SSH, desktop, …)      |
| `audit-recent`         | Tail the most recent decisions from `audit.log`                         |
| `collect-diagnostics`  | Bundle logs and state into a tarball with secrets redacted              |
| `zombie-chat`          | Print the local chat URL and a copy-pasteable SSH tunnel example        |

The installer also drops `verify` and a few GUI shims (`gui-env`,
`screenshot`, `click`, `type`, `key`) under the same directory; the
agent invokes them directly.

## Install subcommands

`scripts/install.sh` is idempotent and exposes several subcommands;
all honour the same `ZOMBIE_*` environment variables documented
above:

| Subcommand  | Effect                                                                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `install`   | Full install (default). Safe to re-run.                               |
| `verify`    | Read-only state check. Does not change state.                         |
| `doctor`    | Explain failures and likely fixes.                                    |
| `repair`    | Apply known-safe fixes (re-assert permissions, re-render `pi/` tree). |
| `uninstall` | Reverse the install (delegates to `scripts/uninstall.sh`).            |

After editing `policy.yaml` or any template under
`/opt/ai-zombie/agent/templates/`, run `sudo ./scripts/install.sh
repair` to re-render the `pi/` tree and restart the chat service.

## Skills

Skill files are short markdown briefs the agent loads via `skill.list`
/ `skill.load`. They are read from two directories:

| Path                         | Purpose                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/opt/ai-zombie/skills/`     | Root-owned, ships with the package (`apt`, `docker`, `gui`, `systemd`, `tailscale`, `ufw`). |
| `/etc/ubuntu-zombie/skills.d/` | Operator-extensible. Same mode/owner contract as `policy.yaml`. |

Drop additional `*.md` files into `/etc/ubuntu-zombie/skills.d/` to
extend the catalogue. Names must be unique across both directories;
shadowing is rejected at load time.

## Advanced environment overrides

Most operators never need these — the defaults match what
`scripts/install.sh` lays down — but they are honoured by the agent
processes and are useful for development, CI, and bespoke layouts:

| Variable                  | Default                                  | Consumer            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `ZOMBIE_DIR`              | `/opt/ai-zombie`                         | installer, agent    |
| `ZOMBIE_SECRETS`          | `${ZOMBIE_DIR}/secrets/env`              | `server.py`, audit  |
| `ZOMBIE_POLICY`           | `/etc/ubuntu-zombie/policy.yaml`         | `policy.py`         |
| `ZOMBIE_AUDIT_LOG`        | `/var/log/ubuntu-zombie/audit.log`       | `audit.py`, `audit-recent` |
| `ZOMBIE_AUDIT_VERBOSE`    | *(unset; off)*                           | `audit.py` (opt-in: adds redacted `stdout_preview`/`stderr_preview` to `tool_call` entries to aid pre-release testing and operator debugging) |
| `ZOMBIE_AUDIT_PREVIEW_BYTES` | `2048`                                | `audit.py` (per-stream preview cap when `ZOMBIE_AUDIT_VERBOSE=1`; hard ceiling 16 KiB) |
| `ZOMBIE_HISTORY_DB`       | `/opt/ai-zombie/state/conversations.db`  | `history.py`        |
| `ZOMBIE_SKILLS_DIR`       | *(unset)*                                | `skill_loader.py` (extra directory consulted first) |
| `ZOMBIE_NODE`             | `which node`                             | pi-ai bridge spawner |
| `ZOMBIE_PI_AI_BRIDGE`     | `${ZOMBIE_DIR}/agent/pi-ai-bridge.mjs`   | pi-ai bridge spawner (used by tests) |
| `ZOMBIE_PI_MONO_BIN`      | `which pi`                               | `pi_mono.py`        |
| `ZOMBIE_PI_MONO_BRIDGE`   | `${ZOMBIE_DIR}/agent/pi-mono-bridge.mjs` | `pi_mono.py` (used by smoke tests) |
| `ZOMBIE_PI_MONO_LOG_DIR`  | `/opt/ai-zombie/state/logs`              | `pi_mono.py`        |
| `ZOMBIE_PI_MONO_SETTINGS` | `/opt/ai-zombie/pi/settings.json`        | `pi_mono.py`        |

## Health check

Run on demand:

```bash
/opt/ai-zombie/bin/health-check
```

Enable the systemd timer for periodic checks:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now ubuntu-zombie-health.timer
```
